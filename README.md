# Pong

This application is an interpretation of the famous game of Pong, the point of which is to throw the opponent balls.
Pong is a simple sports table tennis simulator. A small ball that replaces a ping-pong ball moves along the screen in a linear trajectory. If it hits the perimeter of the playing field, its trajectory changes depending on the angle of collision. If the ball is hit by the player's racket, its movement additionally depends on the speed and direction of the racket. The control of the rackets in Pong is carried out using the paddle controller, which is controlled by pressing the keys. The perimeter of the playing field is marked by the edges of the screen, and the ball can not leave the field through the upper or lower edge. In the upper part of the field, the players ' points are displayed, located in the middle of the screen.
The gameplay consists of players moving their rackets vertically to protect their goal. At the beginning of each round, the ball is given to one of the players, and the round continues until one of the players earns a point. This happens when his opponent can't hit the ball. Over the course of the game, the speed of the ball gradually increases, and so the game becomes more complicated.
